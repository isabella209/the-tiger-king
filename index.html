To check the dwindling population of tigers in India, which came down to just 1,827 in 1972, massive conservation program was initiated in April 1973, known as the ‘Project Tiger’.<br><br>

<div style="color: lavenderblush">
This project aims to maintain a viable population of tigers in India for scientific, economic, aesthetic, cultural and ecological values.<br><br></div>
<div style="color: lavender">
Since then, the tiger population has shown a gradual increase and the census of 1989 puts the tiger population of the country at 4,334.

So far, 19 tiger reserves have been established in the country under this project, covering over 29, 716 sq. km. forest area.</div><hr>

		<h2> There could be as few as 3,890 tigers in the wild, most in isolated pockets spread across increasingly fragmented forests, stretching from India to southeastern China and from the Russian Far East to Sumatra, Indonesia. Largest of all cats, the tiger is one of the most threatened species on Earth. Tigers prefer to eat hoofed animals, but will also prey on fish, birds and even other predators like leopards and bears.</h2>
